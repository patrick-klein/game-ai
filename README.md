# game-ai

This is a small project to create simple games that use reinforcement learning to train AI players

__2048__ and __ticTacToe__ each have their own instances of games and AI classes.  __2048__ is the only one being updated for now.

__library-changes__ has a modified file that can be copied to the appropriate location in your torch installation.  It supresses the print statements within the SGD module
