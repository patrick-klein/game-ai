CONSIDERATIONS

make CUDA an option, not a seperate file
test: don't train other actions to maintain value
	possibly add decay to other rewards
	remove delta after each iteration
need to set flip to false?
create train v test flag in AI or game
only make public functions "methods"
make AI an argument to game, might be copied and not referenced
use lua coroutines  to multi-thread
gnuplot results
"reset" method for game (clears variables)
remove replay memories that have already been trained (none left?)
ticTacToe should accept strings so it can be used outside main
hyperparameter optimization
test/validate using reward instead of overall score
implement cudnn
"forget" less important memories more often

FUTURE

checkers?
