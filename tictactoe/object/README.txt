CONSIDERATIONS

make CUDA an option, not a seperate file
test: don't train other actions to maintain value
	possibly add decay to other rewards
make player a class in tictactoe and simplify selfEval and oppEval
need to set flip to false?
create train v test flag in AI or game
only make public functions "methods"
