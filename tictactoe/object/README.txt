CONSIDERATIONS

make CUDA an option, not a seperate file
test: don't train other actions to maintain value
	possibly add decay to other rewards
make player a class in tictactoe and simplify selfEval and oppEval
need to set flip to false?
create train v test flag in AI or game
only make public functions "methods"
make AI an argument to game, might be copied and not referenced
create optim function.  StochasticGradient is depreciated?
implement human player modes for game
use lua coroutines  to multi-thread
profile code
gnuplot results
drawboard and human playing
"reset" method for game (clears variables)
