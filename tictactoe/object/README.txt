CONSIDERATIONS

make CUDA an option, not a seperate file
test: don't train other actions to maintain value
	possibly add decay to other rewards
	remove delta after each iteration
need to set flip to false?
create train v test flag in AI or game
only make public functions "methods"
make AI an argument to game, might be copied and not referenced
create optim function.  StochasticGradient is depreciated?
implement human player modes for game
use lua coroutines  to multi-thread
gnuplot results
"reset" method for game (clears variables)
remove replay memories that have already been trained
should make computer completely deterministic in challenges
simplify the xState,p1State,p2State garbage in ticTacToe
unify p1,p2,xTurn,oTurn in ticTacToe
ticTacToe should accept strings so it can be used outside main

FUTURE

checkers?
