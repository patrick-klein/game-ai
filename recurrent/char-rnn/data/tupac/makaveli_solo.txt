Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breed freely, see me ride!
Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know what I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in them
Cut them down, to hell is where we send them
My whole team; trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West coast rider, coming right behind you
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free, bomb first

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, through my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention: bless me please Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams, in the dark, evil lurks
Enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip; never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble: we ballin''
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy I hear ya callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live but I got nothing to lose
Just me and you on a one way trip to prison
Selling drugs, we all wrapped up in this living life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary nigga

Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up

How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Looking for suckers cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming "Compton", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up

To live and die in L.A., where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark
Cold hearted bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Trying to floss on him blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Making money off of cuss words, writing again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset liking the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga?
Got me lost in hell
To live and die in L.A. on bail
My angel sing

It's the City of Angels and constant danger
South Central L.A., can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watching the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas getting three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen right across from hell
I can't cry cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Living life thug style
So I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinking Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other... but I promise you this:
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
Let my angel sing

It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson trying to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember K-day?
Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood!
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at?
Niggas gettin' shurrmed out
Snoop Dogg in this muthafucka permed out
M.O.B, Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Herron, Big Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hoping it pay
Getting high, watching time fly: to live and die in LA
Let my angel sing

My family tree, consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin, known to hustle screamin fuck they feelings
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Niggas, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one -- get your cash on, M.O.B
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one; watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein written on my enemy's walls (rest in peace)
Promised if I have a seed, I'mma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nuttin free, get back what you earned, no doubt
Gettin higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah

We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got evicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
Doin wild shit, lookin at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one up deadly -- Babylon beware
Comin' for the Pharoah's kids, retaliation
Makin' legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin'
Niggas in Jerusalem, waiting for signs
"God coming" she's just taking her time, haha
Living by the Nile while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots wondering where the thought’ll go
Brothas getting shot, comin back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga check it (that raw shit)

The preacher want me buried why? Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds, thinkin that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky you say "honor God's people"
Should we cry, when the Pope die, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
Waitin to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin up cash
To the leaders, knowin damn well, they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain time in B.C
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
Times in this crime land, my Thug nation
Do what'chu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say

Why explain the game
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions
If victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Have these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean
Itchin', givin' suckers plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now
Guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope they backwards
Make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack
Words bein' known to explode on contact
Extreme at times
Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me
Truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice
Got a death wish, bitch
Run up, face me and trace with an infared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti
Unload it
Cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw

Code 3
Attack formation
Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin' to get you
Mercy to this madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives
Come closer
Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin' fast
A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws
Never surrender
Death before dishonor stay free
I'm thugged out
Fuck the world cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin'
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels
Can you picture me
Life of and outlaw

To alleviate the stress, spendin time wit you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God everytime I hit it
Hopin you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin like you dyin everytime I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin right from wrong
They say my ghetto intrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me, for the outcome, ban my records - check it
Don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin blinded
Hennesey got me feelin bad, time to stop drinkin
Rollin, in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin?
Sittin in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry; I'mma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu, that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was

I see bloods and crips runnin up the hill
Lookin for a better wayyyyyy
My brothers and sisters it's time to bail
Cause even thug niggas prayyyyyy
Hopin God hear me, I entered the game; look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin time fly; I love my people do or die
But I wonder why, we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, "Nigga get paid."
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say, (Thug Life Baby) c'mon(Westside)

Nothin' but love for you my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact that we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin'
In this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up or we messed up

Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison I miss ya
Cryin' lookin' at my niece's and my newphew's picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
Swearin one day you might leave me, for somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't recieve they mail best believe we riot
Eatin Jack-Mack, Starin at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Aplogizies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world - and all I heard was

Bein' born with less, I must confess only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket gently askin, is there heaven for G's
My homeboy's doin life, his baby momma be stressin
Shedin' tears when her son, finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor
Why you crying? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama? Why they keep on calling me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin in his jail cell, missing my block
Hearin brothers screamin all night, wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
Don't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still struggling, in this white man's world

So tell me why you
Changed to choose a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die
Not gon' cry, why should I care
Like we holding on to lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me, God bless me please keep my seeds healthy
Making all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hoping they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven - ain't no G's in hell
Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take - ended up bein fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see, that we under attack
I never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mama
Hope we make it, to better times, in this white man's world

C'mon
Our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smoking sherm, drinking malt liquor, father forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustling, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out busting
Fuck 'em all, watch em fall screaming
Automatic gunfire exorcising all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas united
Our first date couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I could hardly wait
To bust freely, got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page primetime live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

My girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9, started out my life of crime
With you, bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothing compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'
Me and my girlfriend

I was too immature to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war; never leave me baby
I'm paranoid, sleeping with you, loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waiting by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend

I love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden I'm hearing thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers
Love to watch you at a block party begging for drama
While unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm asking for
Talking to me begging me to just take you around
17, like Brandy, you just "Wanna Be Down"
Talking loud when I tell you be quiet, you move the crowd
Busting rounds, activating a riot. That's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend!

I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed, or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
Tonight we, honor the dead, those who won't be back
So if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An Outlaw, thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry, hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Come rush me to the gates of heaven, let me picture for a while
How I lived for my days as a child, I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold ya head

Hahaha, yo
These felonies be like prophecies beggin' me to stop
Cause these lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flea when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen for me waitin'; is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
Never that, too much tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Saying, "Please show a playa love"
Hold ya head, hold it

God bless the child that can hold his own
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities 'til they capture me
And my, aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Straight conversations all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls
Hold ya head

Twenty-one gun salute
Dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talking bout he left the hospital took five like me
You live in fantasies nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me being a thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Loving how I got you niggas crazy

I heard he was light skinned, stocky with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashing
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the Feds
Same crime, different trials nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention? Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchman
In due time I know you bitch niggas is listening
The world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, "Why you lie?"
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga this M.O.B
So believe me we enemies, I go against all odds

Puffy getting bribed like a bitch
To hide that fact he did some shit he shouldn't have did
So we riding for that
And that nigga that was down for me, resting dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathing or dead
Lord listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a hasa, Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die, goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga
