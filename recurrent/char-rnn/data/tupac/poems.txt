The Rose That Grew from Concrete by Tupac
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack
in the concrete
Proving nature's laws wrong it learned 2 walk
without having feet
Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams
it learned 2 breathe fresh air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else even cared!

In the Depths of Solitude: Dedicated 2 Me by Tupac
I exist in the depths of solitude
pondering my true goal
Trying 2 find peace of mind
and still preserve my soul
Constantly yearning 2 be accepted
and from all receive respect
Never compromising but sometimes risky
and that is my only regret
A young heart with an old soul
how can there be peace
How can I be in the depths of solitude
when there R 2 inside of me
This duo within me causes
the perfect opportunity
2 learn and live twice as fast
as those who accept simplicity

Sometimes I Cry by Tupac
Sometimes when I'm alone
I cry because I'm on my own
The tears I cry R bitter and warm
They flow with life but take no form
I cry because my heart is torn
and I find it difficult 2 carry on
If I had an ear 2 confide in
I would cry among my treasured friends
But who do u know that stops that long
To help another carry on
The world moves fast and it would rather pass u by
than 2 stop and c what makes u cry
It's painful and sad and sometimes I cry
and no one cares about why.

Under the Skies Above: After the Miscarriage by Tupac
My child is out there somewhere
under the skies above
waiting anxiously 4 u and me
2 bless it with our love
A part of me a part of u
and a part of this love we share
will protect my unborn child
who lives dormant out there somewhere
Sometimes in my dreams
I imagine what it would be like
How could I properly guide him
when even I don't know what's right
Whether he is born in wealth or poverty
there will be no deficiency in love
I welcome this gift of life
given from GOD under the skies above

Life Through My Eyes by Tupac
Life through my bloodshot eyes
would scare a square 2 death
poverty, murder, violence
and never a moment 2 rest
Fun and games R few
but treasured like gold 2 me
cuz I realize that I must return
2 my spot in poverty
But mock my words when I say
my heart will not exist
unless my destiny comes through
and puts an end 2 all of this

When Ure Heart Turns Cold: 2 Kristen & My Other Friends Who Wonder by Tupac
When your heart turns cold
it causes your soul 2 freeze
Spreads throughout your spirit
Like a ruthless feeling disease
The walls that once were down
Now stand firm and tall
Safe from hate/love, pain/joy
until u feel nothing at all
When ure heart turns cold
a baby's cry means nothing
A dead corpse is trivial
Mothers neglecting children is daily
Lonliness becomes your routine friend
Death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
if you even sleep at all
u forget ideals and turn off the reason
2 make sure the product is sold
You don't understand how I behave
Just wait till your heart turns Cold!

Untitled by Tupac
Please wake me when I'm free
I cannot bear captivity
where my culture I'm
told holds no significance
I'll wither and die in ignorance
But my inner eye can c a race
who reigned as kings in another place
the green of trees were rich and full
and every man spoke of beautiful
men and women together as equals
War was gone because all was peaceful
But now like a nightmare I wake 2 c
That I live like a prisoner of poverty
Please wake me when I'm free
I cannot bear captivity
4 I would rather be stricken blind
than 2 live without expression of mind

The Eternal Lament by Tupac
From my mind 2 the depths of my soul
I yearn 2 achieve all of my goals
And all of my free time will be spent
On the 1's I miss I will lament
I am not a perfectionist
But still I seek perfection
I am not a great romantic
But yet I yearn 4 affection
Eternally my mind will produce
ways 2 put my talents 2 use
and when I'm done no matter where I've been
I'll yearn 2 do it all again.

Only 4 the Righteous by Tupac
I'm Down with strictly Dope "So"
That means I'm more than u can handle
"Hot" I'm hotter than the wax from
a candle
"Him" that's Roc he's my microphone companion
"Lyrics" full of knowledge truth and understanding
"Hobbies" rapping is my only recreation
"retire" u must be on some kind of medication
"why" because I'll never loosen up my mic grip
"Drugs" never cuz I'm living on the right tip
"sex" only with my girl because I love her
"Babies" impossible I always use a rubber
"Bored" rarely cuz I'm keeping myself busy
"Scratch" nah I leave the cutting up 2 Dize
"Dize?" yeh that's my D.J. he's the greatest
"Word" nah he's paying me 2 say this
"the mind" is something that I cultivate
and treasure
"Thanks" you're welcome and besides it was
my Pleasure

What of Fame? by Tupac
everyone knows ure Face
The world screams ure name
Never again R u alone

The Shining Star Within! (Dedicated 2 Marilyn Monroe) by Tupac
Secrets R hidden within the clouds
of Darkness,
And in this place no one Dares 2 Breathe
in Fear of self-expression
It has been this way
forever and a day
until she came 2 shine
with a spark of innocence and questions
only 2 be answered with Darkness
Not just Darkness but the silent kind
that steals your soul and kills your mind
There was no compassion
for this thriving star
only exploitations
and confused jealousy
u saw no hope and brought the end
Never acknowledging the star within

Starry Night (Dedicated in Memory of Vincent van Gogh) by Tupac
a creative heart, obsessed with satisfying
This dormant and uncaring society
u have given them the stars at night
and u have given them Bountiful Bouquets of Sunflowers
But 4 u there is only contempt
and though u pour yourself into that frame
and present it so proudly
this world could not accept your masterpieces
from the heart
So on that starry night
u gave 2 us and
u took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged
your Life

If I Fail by Tupac
If in my quest 2 achieve my goals
I stumble or crumble and lose my soul
Those that knew me would easily co-sign
There was never a life as hard as mine
No father - no money - no chance and no guide
I only follow my voice inside
If it guides me wrong and I do not win
I'll learn from mistakes and try 2 achieve again.

What is it That I Search 4 by Tupac
I know not what I search 4
But I know I have yet 2 find it,
Because it is invisible 2 the eye
My heart must search 4 it blinded.
And if by chance I find it,
Will I know my mission is achieved?
Can one come 2 conclusions,
Before the question is conceived?
Just as no one knows
what lies beyond the shore,
I will never find the answer 2
what it is that I search 4

The Fear in the Heart of a Man (Dedicated 2 My Heart) by Tupac
against an attacker I will boldly take my stand
because my heart will show fear 4 no man
but 4 a broken heart I run with fright
scared 2 be blind in a vulnerable night
I believe this fear is in every man
some will acknowledge it others will fail 2 understand
there is no fear in a shallow heart
because shallow hearts don't fall apart
but feeling hearts that truly care
are fragile 2 the flow of air
and if I am 2 be true then I must give
my fragile heart
I may receive great joy or u may return it
ripped apart

God by Tupac
when I was alone and had nothing
I asked 4 a friend 2 help me bear the
pain no one came except . . . God
when I needed a breath 2 rise
from my sleep no one could
help me except . . . God
when all I saw was sadness
and I needed answers no one
heard me except . . . . God
so when I'm asked who I
give my unconditional love 2
Look For No other Name
except . . . GOD!

Nothing Can Come Between Us: 4 John by Tupac
let's not talk of money
let us forget the world
4 a moment let's just revel
in our eternal comradery
in my Heart I know
there will never be a day
that I don't remember
the times we shared
u were a friend
when I was at my lowest
and being a friend 2 me
was not easy or fashionable
regardless of how popular
I become u remain
my unconditional friend
unconditional in its truest sense
Did u think I would forget
Did u 4 one moment dream
that I would ignore u
if so remember this from here 2 forever
nothing can come between us

My Dearest One!! by Tupac
There R no words 2 express
how much I truly care
So many times I fantasize of
feelings we can share
My heart has never known
the Joy u bring 2 me
As if GOD knew what I wanted
and made u a reality
I'd die 2 hold u or 2 kiss u
or merely to see your face
my stomach quivers my body shivers
and my heart increases pace
2 give me $ or lots of gold
would not be the same 2 me
I prayed and watched the distant stars
and finally u came 2 me!
Faithfully Yours,
Tupac Amaru Shakur

If There Be Pain... by Tupac
If there be pain,
all u need 2 do
is call on me 2 be with u
And before u hang up the phone
u will no longer be alone
Together we can never fall
because our love will conquer all
If there be pain,
reach out 4 a helping hand
and I shall hold u wherever I am
Every breath I breathe will be into u
4 without u here my joy is through
my life was lived through falling rain
so call on me if there be pain
Faithfully yours,
Tupac Amaru Shakur

Things That Make Hearts Break by Tupac
pretty smiles
deceiving laughs
and people who dream with their eyes open
lonely children
unanswered cries
and souls who have given up hoping
The other thing that breaks hearts
R fairy tales that never come true
and selfish people who lie 2 me
selfish people just like u

Black Woman: 4 Marquita by Tupac
The day I met u I saw strength
and I knew from that point on
that u were pure woman 2 me
possessing a spirit that was strong
I want smiles 2 replace the sorrow
that u have encountered in the past
and since it was strength that attracted me 2 u
it will take strength 2 make it last
My negative side will attempt 2 change u
but please fight that with your all
it will be your strength that keep us both standing
while others around us fall

And Still I Love U by Tupac
I don't have everything
As a matter of fact I don't have anything,
except a dream of a better day
And you, to help me find my way
Being a man I am sure to make mistakes
But to keep you, I would do all it takes
and if it meant my love was really true
I'd gladly die and watch over you
I wish you knew how much I cared
You'd see my love is true. By the life we'd share
Even if you changed your mind and said our love was thru
I'd want to die, continuously cry and still I'd love you

The Mutual Heartache? by Tupac
Introduced with innocence
who would have ever guessed
That u were the one I had
Been so desperately searching 4
u Talk as I do but yet u don't
understand when I mumble
u c as I do but your vision is
blurred by naivete
This is the barrier that separates us
I cannot cross yet
There is 2 much of me that
would frighten u so I live in
heartache because we cannot
fully explore this love and
what of your heartache
Does it feel as sharp as mine
No matter where I go or how long it takes
I will never recover from this mutual heartache.

1st Impressions: 4 Irene by Tupac
Just when I thought I'd seen it all
our paths crossed and met
and I knew from the First glance
that u would be hard 2 4get
your eyes attracted me First
but you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait 2 touch lips
and kiss with my Heart's intentions
when we did it was what I expected
and 4 that moment we erased the tension
of the awkwardness of First Date Jitters
and the initials Blind Date First impressions
we kissed again and I felt the passion
and This was CUPID'S Blessing

A Love Unspoken by Tupac
What of a love unspoken? Is it weaker without a name?
Does this love deserve 2 exist without a title
because I dare not share its name
Does that make me cruel and cold
2 deny the world of my salvation
because I chose 2 let it grow
People tend 2 choke
that which they do not understand
Why shouldn't I be weary
and withhold this love from MAN
What of a love unspoken
no one ever knows
But this is a love that lasts
and in secrecy it grows

Forever And Today by Tupac
U say that u'll love me forever but what about today
As the dusks become dawns and the years pass on will u love me the same way
If so let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure
If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before forever
And if my doubts and ?'s upset u, forgive my fragile heart
I just wanted 2 know if you'd love me forever
Before Today would START!

When I Do Kiss U by Tupac
I haven't yet for reasons of your own
But soon I'm sure you'll tire from being alone
u haven't recovered from the pain of the past
So u show me affection behind the wall of glass
But when I do finally kiss u
u will realize at last my heart was true

Carmencita of the Bronx! (Dedicated to Carmen) by Tupac
u saw innocence at its best
I wanted u more than I wanted me
I remember my last thought at night was of u
and my first thought in the morning was of u
It has been a long time since I've actually
sat and adored u but every once in awhile
your beautiful smile guides me through a day
I hear u R with another and u R expecting
I wish u good luck he is lucky 2 be able
2 wake up 2 u each morning
c u in heaven!

Untitled #2 by Tupac
Every word
cuts 2 the heart
conversations R ended
be4 they start
is this what u want?
is this what I want?
is this what
must be?
This is not a game
This is a love
one should be played
The other cherished
I feel 2 hearts breaking...
is this what u want?
is this what I want?
is this what must be?

Love Is Just Complicated by Tupac
you ask me 2 communicate
what it is I feel within
I search 4 words 2 assist
but I find none 2 help me begin
I guess love is just complicated
Love
is
just
complicated.
I thought I knew my heart's desire
I thought I quenched my burning fire
I thought I wanted "A"
But "A" was 2 mixed up with "B"
Then "C" made me more confused
So "A" turned off me and "B" feels
better. "C" is upset and lonely
and me, I think Love is complicated.
Love
is
just
complicated.

Elizabeth: A Different Love (From B.S.A.) by Tupac
I remember when u were LOST
and your soul was in the wind
It was at this awkward moment
that u and I became friends
But then your soul was found
and u discovered celibacy
But with this u forgot about me
and our bond was a memory
And now I c u felt it
the bond we made before
I pray 2 God it stands
and severs never more

I Know My Heart Has Lied Before by Tupac
I know my heart has lied before
but now it speaks with honesty
of an invisible bond of friendship
that was formed in secrecy
Coming from me this may seem hard
but 2 GOD I swear it's truth
We R friends for eternity
and Forever I will always love u
With All My Heart,
&
"Spirit"
P.S. Just so u don't forget that
I am here for u. U R a true
friend.

From First Glance (4 Michelle From Zap's: Feb 1, 1990) by Tupac
From first glance I know exactly what would Be
u and I have perfect hearts destined one day 2 Be
The circumstances don't even matter because my heart never lies
And if u don't admit 2 this it is u who will be surprised

1 for April by Tupac
2 me your name alone is poetry
I barely know u and already
I can't explain this feeling I feel
4 APRIL
I want 2 c u from the moment
u leave my side till the moment u return
My nonchalant cold heart finally has eyes only
4 APRIL
So now I risk it all
Just 4 the feeling of joy u bring me
I accept the ridicule
in exchange for the words u share with me
All of this & much more I will do
4 APRIL

Wife 4 Life: Dedicated 2 April by Tupac
I hope u heard me when I asked
u that night 2 be my wife
Not for this year or next
But mine for all your life
2 accept me when I sin
and understand me when I fail
Not 2 mention standing the rain
which comes down as hard as hail
I am not the best of men
My faults could scare the night
But my heart is always pure 2 my wife 4 life

Tears from a Star: 4 Me & April by Tupac
My tears they fall with passion
Like tears conceived from stars
Full of brightness & energy
Seen only from afar
Tonight these tears are
full of pain but also I can feel
relief from my heart
Because the stigma is revealed
unfaithful and unforgiven
I cannot bear 2 let this be
So I must be pure
2 only her for eternity

March 1st - The Day After April (Dedicated 2 the Divorce of Me & April) by Tupac
Today I wake & feel even lonelier
But I c positive potential
My hear shook much like the Quake
Then the pain was gone
The arctic breeze formed the fortress
Barricading my fragile Heart from PAIN
It is not that I don't love u
and it was because I did love u
that I must move on
as long as I breathe
I will remember
"WE AS 2"

Why Must U Be Unfaithful (4 Women) by Tupac
MEN!
u shouldn't listen 2 your selfish heart
It doesn't really have a brain
Besides keeping u alive
Its existence is in vain
"How could I be so mean,
and say your heart has no place?"
Because mortal men fall in love again
as fast as they changed their face
I may be cruel, but think awhile about
The hearts that u have broken
Match that with the empty vows
and broken promises u've spoken
I am not saying females R perfect
Because men we know it's not true
But why must u be unfaithful
If her heart is true 2 u!!!!
-Shakur

The Power of a Smile (4 Renee) by Tupac
The power of a gun can kill
and the power of Fire can Burn
The power of wind can chill
and the power of the mind can learn
The power of anger can rage
inside until it tears u apart
But the Power of a Smile
especially yours can heal a frozen Heart

Genesis (The Rebirth of My Heart): Dedicated 2 Renee Ross by Tupac
First there was nothing
Not even the Faint echo of a song
Loneliness was daily 4 me
until u came along
There was a gleam of STARS in your eyes
I thought I'd never feel this way again
But u were the one 2 reach into my heart
And find in me a Friend
I could not ignore the magnetism
that I felt when u were near
And any problems plaguing my mind
would suddenly disappear
It was the rebirth of my heart
The day u became my friend
Because I knew from the moment
I held u that I would find love again

Love Within a Storm (4 Elizabeth) by Tupac
We made love within a storm
in the midst of passion and chaos
somewhere, somehow our true bond
of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm
The rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this trauma
will learn 2 bring their love farther
But now the storm has passed
and the seas of our friendship R calm
But as long as I live I will remember
the Love within the storm

What Can I Offer Her? by Tupac
All of my life I dreamed of meeting one
with immense beauty, and once I found her
I would charm her and she'd be mine
forever.
I have found her and indeed she is all
I wished for and more but she is
not charmed nor intrigued. Then I
think 2 myself "What can I offer her?"
The tears warm my eyes and blur my
vision. I stick 2 my stance of bravado
and give her the same uninterested look
she gave me. She was so beautiful
But what can I offer her

Jada by Tupac
U R the omega of my heart
The foundation 4 my conception of Love
When I think of what a black woman should be
Its u that I First think of
U will never fully understand
How Deeply my Heart Feels 4 u
I worry that we'll grow apart
And I'll end up losing u
U bring me 2 climax without sex
And u do it all with regal grace
U r my heart in Human Form
A Friend I could never replace

The Tears in Cupid's Eyes (4 Jada) by Tupac
The day u chose 2 leave me
it rained constantly outside
in truth I swore the rain 2 be
The tears in Cupid's eyes
TS

Cupid's Smile II by Tupac
I ran outside 2 feel the rain
and I stayed outside awhile
When the rain was done along came the sun
and this was Cupid's Smile!

What I See! by Tupac
With my eyes closed I can c
we have a chance 2 discover ecstasy
but the clouds of doubt have made u blind
but the clouds of doubt have made u blind
so u R afraid of the emotions that u may find
I know that u've been hurt before
but this is no excuse 4 u 2 ignore
the seed that cupid planted, in hopes that we would sow
This infant emotion deserves 2 breathe so why won't u let it grow
A neglected flower will wither and on its own it will surely die
But with honesty, passion, and mutual respect we can Soar Beyond The Sky
So please don't follow what u c follow the rhythm within your heart
Believe in me though u cannot c what lies within the Dark

In the Midst of Passion by Tupac
In the midst of passion 2 figures stand
emerged in ecstasy joined hand and hand
words R unnecessary feelings R heart
the body takes control deaf 2 words
It is at this stage that I think of u
in gratitude 4 this joy u have exposed me 2
Each Day is Bright with you as the Dawn
with the collapse of each night a strong bond is born
In the midst of passion I remember your kiss
I reminisce about your touch and suddenly miss
the scent u wear and the tone of your voice
Only u can be my choice
In the midst of passion
I c u & me
Lost in constant ecstasy!!

2 People with 1 Wish by Tupac
There were 2 people with one wish
2 Live a Life filled with LOVE
2 GOD they would pray that 2gether they'd stay
under the stars above
But someone else made a wish
at the same time on the same breath
And although the wish 4 love was granted
So was this evil wish 4 Death
Now I make a wish
sealed with tears and laughter
It is my wish that these 2 loves
R reunited in the hereafter

Hours Pass By by Tupac
I think of u in my arms
And what it would be like 2 Make Love
I think of u raising my SEED
And what they'd be made of
I think of how alone I was
Before u came 2 be
I think of the joy I felt
when u said u thought of me
I'm proud to be the heart u
choose 2 make a friend
Hours pass by and Cupid cries
until we meet again

Just a Breath of Freedom (4 Nelson Mandela) by Tupac
Held captive 4 your politics
They wanted 2 break your soul
They ordered the extermination
of all minds they couldn't control
4 u the fate was far worse
than just a brutal homicide
They caged u like an animal
and watched u slowly die inside
As u Breathe your first air of freedom
on the day u become a free man
Raise your Regal Brow in Pride
4 now you R in God's Hands
The life of many were given
so that the day would one day come
That the devils in Power at Pretoria
would pay for the evil crimes they've done

For Mrs. Hawkins (In Memory of Yusef Hawkins) by Tupac
This poem is addressed 2 Mrs. Hawkins
who lost her son 2 a racist society
I'm not out 2 offend the positive souls
only the racist dogs who lied 2 me
An American culture plagued with nights
like the night Yusef was killed
if it were reversed it would be the work
of a savage but this white killer was just strong-willed
But Mrs. Hawkins as sure as I'm a Panther
with the blood of Malcolm in my veins
America will never rest
if Yusef dies in vain!

The Sun and The Moon by Tupac
Your ways R similar 2 the rays of the sun
Warm 2 many but 2 strong 4 some
The more u R needed the brighter u shine
Watched 4 2 long and your brilliance will blind
The eyes of mortal men who threaten u with Doom
They regret 2 c u set but it is time 4 the moon
-TS

Fallen Star (4 Huey P. Newton) by Tupac
They could never understand
what u set out 2 do
instead they chose 2
ridicule u
when u got weak
They loved the sight
of your dimming
and flickering starlight
How could they understand what was so intricate
2 be loved by so many, so intimate
they wanted 2 c your lifeless corpse
This way u could not alter the course
of ignorance that they have set
2 make my people forget
what they have done for much 2 long
2 just forget and carry on
I had loved u forever because of who u R
And now I mourn our fallen star

Government Assistance or My Soul by Tupac
It would be like a panther
asking a panther hunter
4 some meat, all
High school dropouts R not DUMB
All unemployed aren't lazy
and there R many days I hunger
But I would go hungry and homeless
Before the American Government gets my soul

Family Tree by Tupac
Because we all spring
from different trees
does not mean
we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
or in the vast forest in which it breathes
the tree must fight 2 breed
among the evils of the weeds
I find greatness in the tree
that grows against all odds
it blossoms in darkness
and gives birth 2 promising pods.
I was the tree who grew from weeds
and wasn't meant 2 be
ashamed I'm not in fact I am proud
of my thriving family tree

Or My Soul (Dedicated 2 Moms, Dedicated 2 the Powers That B) by Tupac
The choice is no stranger 2 poverty
your soul or Government Assistance
I'm 18 in a country with no path
4 a young unaddicted Black youth with a Dream
Instead I am giving the Ultimatum

When Ure Hero Falls: 4 My Hero (My Mother) by Tupac
When your hero falls from grace
all fairy tales R uncovered
myths exposed and pain magnified
the greatest pain discovered
u taught me 2 be strong
but I'm confused 2 c u so weak
u said never 2 give up
and it hurts 2 c u welcome defeat
when ure Hero falls so do the stars
and so does the perception of tomorrow
without my Hero there is only
me alone 2 deal with my sorrow.
your Heart ceases 2 work
and your soul is is not happy at all
what R u expected 2 do
when ure only Hero falls

Untitled #3 by Tupac
Strength is overcome by weakness
Joy is overcome by Pain
The night is overcome by Brightness
and Love - it remains the same

U R Ripping Us Apart !!! (Dedicated 2 Crack) by Tupac
Before u came the triangle never broke
we were bonded and melded as one
But as the 2 pushed u away
The one got weak and embraced u
and now u R ripping us Apart
The worst feeling of helplessness
The greatest pain has rested in my heart
The vision of heaven fades
and the nightmare of loneliness has started
My Hero has been defeated by you
and now what can I do
watch as u Destroy us
and our love is finally Through
I know the worst is Here
I feel it in my Heart
u got into the circle
now you're tearing us apart !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A River That Flows Forever by Tupac
As long as some suffer
The River Flows Forever
As long as there is pain
The River Flows Forever
As strong as a smile can be
The River Will Flow Forever
And as long as u R with me
we'll ride the River Together

Can U C the Pride in the Panther by Tupac
Can u c the pride in the pantha
as he glows in splendor and grace
Toppling OBSTACLES placed in the way
of the progression of his race
Can u c the pride in the Pantha
as she nurtures her young all alone
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that it's planted in stone
CAN'T u c the Pride in the panthas
as they unify as one
The flower blooms with brilliance
and outshines the ray of the Sun

Where There Is a Will.... by Tupac
Where there is a will
there is a way
2 Search and discover
a Better Day
Where a positive heart
is all u Need
2 Rise Beyond
and succeed
Where young mind grow
and respect each other
Based on their Deeds
and not their color
When times R dim
say as I say..
"Where there is a will
There is a way!"

Liberty Needs Glasses by Tupac
excuse me but Lady Liberty needs glasses
And so does Mrs. Justice by her side
Both the broads R blind as bats
Stumbling thru the system
Justice bumped into Mutulu and
Trippin' on Geronimo Pratt
But stepped right over Oliver
And his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her Big Toe on Mandela
And liberty was misquoted by the Indians
slavery was a learning phase
Forgotten without a verdict
while Justice is on a rampage
4 endangered surviving Black males
I mean really if anyone really valued life
and cared about the masses
They'd take 'em both 2 Pen Optical
and get 2 pairs of glasses

How Can We Be Free by Tupac
Sometimes I wonder about this race
Because we must be blind as Hell
2 think we live in equality
while Nelson Mandela rots in a jail cell
Where the shores of Howard Beach
are full of Afrikan corpses
And those that do live 2 be 18
Bumrush 2 join the Armed Forces
This so called "Home of the Brave"
why isn't anybody Backing us up!
When they c these crooked ass Redneck cops
constantly Jacking us up
Now I bet some punk will say I'm racist
I can tell by the way you smile at me
then I remember George Jackson, Huey Newton
and Geronimo 2 hell with Lady Liberty

The Promise by Tupac
"I will give u Liberty, But First give me ure spirit,
This I must confiscate Because the evil Fear it."
I too would be afraid of passion governed by reason
An open mind 2 trying times when corruption is in season
The promise that they claim
2 be completely true
is hypocrisy at its finest
A trick 2 silence u
never will I Believe a promise
from the masters of the Art
Trickery does not succeed
with those with Honest Hearts

And 2morrow by Tupac
Today is filled with anger
Fueled with hidden hate
Scared of being outcast
Afraid of common fate
Today is built on tragedies
which no one wants 2 face
Nightmares 2 humanities
and morally disgraced
Tonight is filled with rage
Violence in the air
Children bred with ruthlessness
Because no one at home cares
Tonight I lay my head down
But the pressure never stops
gnawing at my sanity
content when I am dropped
But 2morrow I c change
A chance 2 build anew
Built on spirit, intent of heart
and ideals based on truth
And 2morrow I wake with second wind
And strong because of pride
2 know I fought with all my heart 2 keep my dream alive

No-Win (Dream poem) by Tupac
Backed into a corner
alone and very confused
Tired of running away
My manhood has been abused
Not my choice 2 be so blunt
But u must fight fire with flame
I allowed myself 2 run once
and was haunted by the shame
if I must kill I will and if I must do it again
I would but the situation is a no-win

The Unanswerable? by Tupac
QUESTION:
WHEN WILL THERE BE PEACE ON EARTH?
ANSWER: WHEN THE EARTH FALLS 2 PIECES!!

Nightmares (Dedicated 2 Those Curious) by Tupac
I pour my heart in2 this poem
and look 4 the meaning of Life
the rich and powerful always prevail
and the less fortunate strive through strife
MISTAKES R MADE 2 be 4given
we R 2 young 2 stress and suffer
The path of purity and positivity
has always ridden rougher
Your insatiable desire 2 find perfection
Has made your faults magnify
curiosity can take Blame
For the evil that makes u cry
It isn't a good feeling when u disobey your Heart
The nightmares haunt your Soul and your nerves R ripped apart

So I Say GOODBYE (Nov 20) by Tupac
I'm going in2 this not knowing what I'll find
but I've decided 2 follow my heart and abandon my mind
and if there be pain I know that at least I gave my all
and it is better 2 have loved and lost than 2 not love at all
In the morning I may wake 2 smile or maybe 2 cry
but first 2 those of my past I must say goodbye

In The Event of my Demise by Tupac
In the event of my Demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a principle
or a belief that I had lived 4
I will die before my time
Because I feel the shadow's depth
so much I wanted 2 accomplish
Before I reached my death
I have come 2 grips with the possibility
and wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my Demise!
