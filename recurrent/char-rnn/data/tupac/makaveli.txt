Bomb First (My Second Reply) by Makaveli
{​Crowd noise and unintelligible muttering that many falsely believe is "Suge shot me"}​
[Intro: Press Release]
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur
Has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli"
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists'
Street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac -
Excuse me - Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep
Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is:
Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac - rather Makaveli
Was not available for comment, but released this statement:
[2Pac]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money. riders and punks Which side are you on?
*gunshots*, *followed by several encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fucking talking?
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz)
Solo Shit, Bring it!
[Verse 1: 2Pac/Makaveli]
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breed freely, see me ride!
Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know what I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in them
Cut them down, to hell is where we send them
My whole team; trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West coast rider, coming right behind you
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free, bomb first
[Hook: 2Pac / Makaveli]
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
For so many days, in so many ways, we've been ducking strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'mma leave this bitch
Yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfucking cash, mane
Then what is your motherfucking purpose? Narcing service
E.D.I. Mean born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch
[Bridge: 2Pac]
Biatch
Come on, bring it, down with it
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first then we ride
Hey get that nigga
[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're telling fairy tales, dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfucking one?
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flipping chips
Getting rich even though it's hard
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, cause yo, my man took 5
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time
[Outro: 2Pac]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
(Start of "Hail Mary")
Let us pray my niggas
For we have definitely sinned

Hail Mary by Makaveli
[Intro: 2Pac]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati all through your body
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me!
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh
[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, through my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention: bless me please Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams, in the dark, evil lurks
Enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip; never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary
[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble: we ballin''
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy I hear ya callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live but I got nothing to lose
Just me and you on a one way trip to prison
Selling drugs, we all wrapped up in this living life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary nigga
[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me, thug-living, getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs
[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever and that mothafucka
Nasty new street slugger, my heat seeks suckers
On the regular, mashing in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds til the draw that's when I'm deadin' ya feet first
You've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preaching church
I gave you love, now you eating dirt
Needing work and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond: when I was broke I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas get your pay and weight up
[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
[During Hook: Prince Ital Joe]
We've been traveling on this weary road
Sometimes life can take a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail mary
We won't worry, everything well curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything well curry
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary
[Hook: 2Pac]
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga, run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La-lalala-la-la-la-la
[Outro]
Westside, Outlawz
Makaveli the Don, solo
Killuminati, the 7 days

Toss It Up by Makaveli
[Intro: 2Pac]
The money behind the dreams
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin' war we got
My other Capo in this big-ass
Conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who's he coming through right now?
Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up
[Danny Boy]
Feel this baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on!
[Jojo]
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me, baby
[Hook: Danny Boy & JoJo]
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
[Bridge]
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
[Verse 2: K-Ci]
Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm, that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang
Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling!
[Aaron Hall]
Nasty man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty titillating delight-ah
Back it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me
[Hook: K-Ci & Aaron Hall]
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
So won't you play on
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Looking for suckers cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming "Compton", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up
[Hook]
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
[Outro: 2Pac]
Yeah no doubt
Toss it up now
Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about tossing it up
And then want to do a player song?
(you so fat, you and Lil' Kim need a weight scale to lay down in bed
We are not little kids, you fat ass, you feelin' threatened)
How can non-players do it? (you know who I'm talking bout)
Teddy Riley, who? Puffy? who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touching us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy
It's on! Toss it up, we took you on
And we took y'all beat (toss it up)
You know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat
Cause you wasn't rocking it right! (toss it up now)
Tired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now
Yeah, toss it up now!

To Live & Die in L.A. by Makaveli
[Intro]
“Street Science, you’re on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac’s new one?”
“I love 2Pac’s new record”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates — ahh— tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’..."
[Verse 1: 2Pac Makaveli]
To live and die in L.A., where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark
Cold hearted bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Trying to floss on him blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Making money off of cuss words, writing again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset liking the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga?
Got me lost in hell
To live and die in L.A. on bail
My angel sing
[Hook: Val Young]
To Live and Die in L.A., it's the place to be. You've got to be there to know it, everybody wanna see. (Repeat)
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's the City of Angels and constant danger
South Central L.A., can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watching the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas getting three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen right across from hell
I can't cry cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Living life thug style
So I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinking Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other... but I promise you this:
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
Let my angel sing
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson trying to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember K-day?
Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood!
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at?
Niggas gettin' shurrmed out
Snoop Dogg in this muthafucka permed out
M.O.B, Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Herron, Big Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hoping it pay
Getting high, watching time fly: to live and die in LA
Let my angel sing
[Outro: 2Pac]
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumping my shit
Making my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all motherfuckers
L.A., California Love part motherfucking two
Without gay ass Dre

Blasphemy by 2Pac
{​*"To Live & Die in L.A." fades out*}​
[Snipped of a religious TV show]
God has a plan -- and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our saviour
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity, for my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and saviour
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy
[2Pac]
2Pac don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed -- and I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me -- remember what my pops told me
My family tree, consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin, known to hustle screamin fuck they feelings
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Niggas, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one -- get your cash on, M.O.B
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one; watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein written on my enemy's walls (rest in peace)
Promised if I have a seed, I'mma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nuttin free, get back what you earned, no doubt
Gettin higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
[Hook: Prince Ital]
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud
Using the name of the Lord in vain
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
[2Pac]
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got evicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
Doin wild shit, lookin at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one up deadly -- Babylon beware
Comin' for the Pharoah's kids, retaliation
Makin' legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin'
Niggas in Jerusalem, waiting for signs
"God coming" she's just taking her time, haha
Living by the Nile while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots wondering where the thought’ll go
Brothas getting shot, comin back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga check it (that raw shit)
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
[Hook]
[2Pac]
The preacher want me buried why? Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds, thinkin that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky you say "honor God's people"
Should we cry, when the Pope die, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
Waitin to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin up cash
To the leaders, knowin damn well, they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain time in B.C
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
Times in this crime land, my Thug nation
Do what'chu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say
[Hook] - 4X
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallow be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
In earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us, unevil
For God, is the kingdom, and the power
And the glory forever, and ever, and ever

Life Of An Outlaw by Makaveli
[Hook]
In the life we live as thugs
Everbody fuckin' with us so can't you
See it's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my gun in hand
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Why explain the game
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions
If victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Have these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean
Itchin', givin' suckers plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now
Guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope they backwards
Make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack
Words bein' known to explode on contact
Extreme at times
Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me
Truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice
Got a death wish, bitch
Run up, face me and trace with an infared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti
Unload it
Cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw
[Hook]
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Code 3
Attack formation
Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin' to get you
Mercy to this madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives
Come closer
Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin' fast
A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws
Never surrender
Death before dishonor stay free
I'm thugged out
Fuck the world cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin'
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels
Can you picture me
Life of and outlaw
[Hook w/ 2Pac talking]
Yes, No doubt, Soldiers in position
Yes, Can you picture this, attack formation
No retreat, no surrender
[Verse 3: Young Noble]
City under siege
It's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves
G, deep from the street
Plenty beef
I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb Deep
This nigga from behind trying to creep
No half-wits, no straps, jack
It's on to bounce back
An ounce of wrath so bad,it snatched my style on death
Tell the reaper I was sent to get ya
Snip with clippers
Get the picture
I wrote my life down like a scripture
[E.D.I.]
And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy
A matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody living soley for themselves
Too high strung to lend help
To somebody who be needing it
You know we lost hope and we needing it
Wit the evil it's forever
But it might be low down, scandalous
Like a tramp is
All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit
6 months in advaced to what we plotted
Approved to go on swole and now I got it
[Kastro]
Uh, crack my window
Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow hand to hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into morning
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'
And let my clout speak for it's self
No doubt
Outlaw
Outta my mind, outta time
You're all blind
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, cause it is
Perhaps finally I'll adapt to it over the years as an outlaw
[(2Pac) & Napoleon]
(Eh, Napoleon)
What's up, nigga?
(Would you die for me, nigga?)
Hell yeah
(Would you kill for me, nigga?)
On my grandmother, nigga
(Ah yo)
What's up
(Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out)
Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites
Snakes are all alike
THUG LIFE break night
Drink till we fist fight
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase the air hide your stash
Beware for any marks
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly
And let me bust back to them niggas til they all cold and sweaty
Hook x4 with variations in background vocals

Just Like Daddy by Makaveli
[Intro]
Outlawz, in this
No doubt
Death Row, Makaveli Records
You can call me daddy, uh
I'll be ya daddy, that's right, uh
Just like daddy
Fo' the ladies
Hahaha
[Hook]
Come with me every time we ro'
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
[Verse 1: E.D.I-Mean]
I met her when she was younger
Her daddy died when she was younger
Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
Her eyes shined of love, a diamond in the rough
The kind that you could love; not yet touch, but so much, potential
Youngster let me guide ya mental
And to a place, with a sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace, you was born with that face
Nothin but pure beauty; so for an eternity, I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah (souljah) yeah, baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy
[Makaveli]
To alleviate the stress, spendin time wit you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God everytime I hit it
Hopin you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin like you dyin everytime I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me
[Hook]
Come with me every time we ro'
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
[Verse 2: Khadafi]
Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
But when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apologetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin what we could do
Gettin' high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
[Young Noble]
Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, won't disrespect ya
My age is young, out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure
[Hook repeat to fade]
Come with me every time we ro'
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy
[2Pac during Hook]

Krazy by Makaveli
[Intro]
Throw me a cigarette, dawg! {​*inhales*}​
They got me feelin crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motherfucker
Makaveli the Don, representin' the Outlawz
Bad Azz representin the L.B.C Crew
So what'cha wanna do? Y'know how we do it
{​*overlapping the [Intro]*}​
.. puffin on lye
Hopin that it get me high
Got a nigga goin cra-zy
Oh yeah, I feel cra-zy
[Hook]
Time goes by, puffin on lye
Hopin that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin cra-zy
Oh yeah, I feel cra-zy
(Tell 'em bout it)
[2Pac]
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin right from wrong
They say my ghetto intrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me, for the outcome, ban my records - check it
Don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin blinded
Hennesey got me feelin bad, time to stop drinkin
Rollin, in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin?
Sittin in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry; I'mma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu, that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was
[Hook - repeat 2X]
(One, two, three, four)
[2Pac]
I see bloods and crips runnin up the hill
Lookin for a better wayyyyyy
My brothers and sisters it's time to bail
Cause even thug niggas prayyyyyy
Hopin God hear me, I entered the game; look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin time fly; I love my people do or die
But I wonder why, we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, "Nigga get paid."
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say, (Thug Life Baby) c'mon(Westside)
[Hook - repeat 2X]
[Bad Azz]
God help me out here, cause I'm posessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
Cause money's like a stong prescription drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin bout the paper wit the pictures of the president's, head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin money cause it's cursed
Makin money makes a difference day by day so I gotta stay
Paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my, peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life doin right, or did life livin dumb
Who has the answers? I wonder; I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) Cause they don't even know
A million thangs run through my mind(through my mind)
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin time(You ain't gotta be in jail...to be doin time)
[Hook - repeat 2X]
{​*Chorus repeats while 2Pac speaks below*|
[2Pac]
I feel fucked up in this bitch
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate Thai, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha, all that shit
I'm fucked up in this motherfucker, and Hennesey don't help
And Hennesey don't help - Thug Passion in this muh'fucker
Makaveli the Don puttin it down to the fullest, maximum overload
3 Day Theory - Killuminati to your body
With the impact of a 12 gauge shotty
Double-I slugs, no love, straight thugs
One time for my niggas in the jail cell
(One time for my niggas locked up)
One time for my niggas doin life in hell
(One time for my niggas and shit, one time)
One time for my niggas in the jail cell
(One time)
One time for my niggas doin life in hell
(One time for my niggas locked down)
One time for my niggas in the jail cell
(For my niggas locked up, one time)
One time for my niggas on Death Row
(One time for my niggas on the Row)
For my niggas on Death Row
One time for my niggas livin, broke
(Westside, California style, L.A.!)
One time for my niggas livin, broke
(You know what time it is, no doubt)
One time for my niggas in the.. jail cell
(Get high, puffin on lye, wonder if it get me high)
(Yeah, yeah, crazy..)

White Man'z World by Makaveli
[Intro]
You go bustin' your fist against a stone wall
You're not usin' your brain
That's what the white man wants you to do
Look at you, what makes you ashamed of bein black
[2Pac]
Nothin' but love for you my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact that we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin'
In this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up or we messed up
[Verse 1]
Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison I miss ya
Cryin' lookin' at my niece's and my newphew's picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
Swearin one day you might leave me, for somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't recieve they mail best believe we riot
Eatin Jack-Mack, Starin at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Aplogizies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world - and all I heard was
[Refrain]
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone
Only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!)
Was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white man’s world
All my ghetto motherfuckers be proud to be black and be proud
All my little black seeds, born black in this white man's world
To have this shit like this, cause ain't nobody got it like this
All these motherfuckers wanna be like us, they all wanna be like us
To be the have naughts, all hail
God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt
[Verse 2]
Bein' born with less, I must confess only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket gently askin, is there heaven for G's
My homeboy's doin life, his baby momma be stressin
Shedin' tears when her son, finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor
Why you crying? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama? Why they keep on calling me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin in his jail cell, missing my block
Hearin brothers screamin all night, wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
Don't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still struggling, in this white man's world
[Refrain]
[*megaphone* over Hook]
We must fight, for brother Mumia
We must fight, for brother Mutulu
And we must fight, for brother Ruchell Magee
We must fight, for brother Geronimo Pratt
We must fight, for (?), Zulu, (?)
We must fight, for countless political prisoners
Who are locked up falsely by this white man
[Verse 3]
So tell me why you
Changed to choose a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die
Not gon' cry, why should I care
Like we holding on to lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me, God bless me please keep my seeds healthy
Making all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hoping they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven - ain't no G's in hell
Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take - ended up bein fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see, that we under attack
I never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mama
Hope we make it, to better times, in this white man's world
[Refrain]
[Khalid Abdul Muhammad]
"You're out of touch with reality!
There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms
Calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people
White and black, red yellow, and, and brown
Poor and vulnerable are suffering, in this nation."
[2Pac over Hook]
Never that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us
We've been here all this time they ain't took us out
They can never take us out
No matter what they say, about us bein extinct
About us being endangered species, we ain't NEVER gon' leave this
We ain't never gon' walk off this planet, unless Y'ALL choose to
Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't them that's killin us it's US that's killin us
It ain't them that's knockin us off, it's US that's knockin us off
I'm tellin you better watch it, or be a victim
Be a victim, in this white man's world
.. born black, in this white man's world, no doubt
And it's dedicated to my motherfuckin teachers
Mutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal
Sekou Odinga, all the real O.G.'s, we out
[Minister Farrakhan - Oct. 17, 1995]
The seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking
Of the founding fathers, that this was, to be a nation
By white people, and for white people
Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-white people
Were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation

Me and My Girlfriend by Makaveli
[Intro: Virginya Slim]
Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot when you punk-ass niggas don't!
Nigga West-SIDE! What?!
Bring it on!
[Refrain: 2Pac]
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doing 85 when we ride, trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
C'mon
Our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smoking sherm, drinking malt liquor, father forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustling, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out busting
Fuck 'em all, watch em fall screaming
Automatic gunfire exorcising all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas united
Our first date couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I could hardly wait
To bust freely, got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page primetime live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop
[Interlude: Virginya Slim]
What? I'm busting on you punk ass niggas!
Run, nigga, run! I'm on your ass nigga!
Run, nigga, duck and hide when I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga, yeah! Westside! Uh! Uh! Uh!
Die, nigga, die!
[Continuation of Verse 1: 2Pac]
My girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9, started out my life of crime
With you, bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothing compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'
Me and my girlfriend
[Hook x2]
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I was too immature to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war; never leave me baby
I'm paranoid, sleeping with you, loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waiting by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden I'm hearing thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers
Love to watch you at a block party begging for drama
While unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm asking for
Talking to me begging me to just take you around
17, like Brandy, you just "Wanna Be Down"
Talking loud when I tell you be quiet, you move the crowd
Busting rounds, activating a riot. That's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend!
[Hook] x2
[Refrain] x3

Hold Ya Head by Makaveli
[Intro: Malcolm X prison scene]
Yo, Jackson! A 231549
Yeah, close four! Comin' down!
Crichlow! A 5991301
Close five! Comin' down!
Look at Satan, I see him
[2Pac]
My homeboys in Clinton and Rikers Island
All the penitentiaries
Mumia, Mutulu, Geronimo, Sekon
All the political prisoners
San Quentin (who can save you).. all the jailhouses
I'm with you
[2Pac & Tyrone Wrice]
Yeah
One thug, one thug, How do we keep the music playing
You're listenin' to the sounds of one, thug
One thug, one thug, How do we get ahead
You're listenin' to the sounds of..
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed, or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
Tonight we, honor the dead, those who won't be back
So if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An Outlaw, thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry, hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Come rush me to the gates of heaven, let me picture for a while
How I lived for my days as a child, I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold ya head
[Hook: Tyrone Wrice & 2Pac]
How do we keep the music playing
Yes, you got to hold ya head
How do we get ahead, hold your head!
Too many young black brothers are dying
Yes, you got to hold ya head
Livin' fast, too fast
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Hahaha, yo
These felonies be like prophecies beggin' me to stop
Cause these lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flea when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen for me waitin'; is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
Never that, too much tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Saying, "Please show a playa love"
Hold ya head, hold it
[Hook: Tyrone Wrice & 2Pac]
How do we keep the music playing
You got to hold ya head
How do we get ahead, c'mon hold your head
Too many young black brothers are dying
Yes, hold ya head
Livin' fast, too fast
The weed got me tweakin' in my mind, I'm thinkin'
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
God bless the child that can hold his own
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities 'til they capture me
And my, aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Straight conversations all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls
Hold ya head
[Hook: Tyrone Wrice & 2Pac]
How do we keep the music playing
You got to hold ya head
How do we get ahead, c'mon, hold your head
Too many young black brothers are dying
Yes, hold ya head
Livin' fast, too fast
You got to hold ya head
How do we keep the music playing
Yes, you got to hold ya head
How do we get ahead
[Outro during hook]
No matter how hard it get, feel me
Get the weed, drink a drink, read a book
Watch the stars, get some pussy, whatever

Against All Odds by Makaveli
[Intro]
One love, one thug, one nation
Twenty-one gun salute
I'm hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, getting blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
[Verse 1]
Twenty-one gun salute
Dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talking bout he left the hospital took five like me
You live in fantasies nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me being a thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Loving how I got you niggas crazy
[Hook 1]
Against all odds
Hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, getting blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds
Hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
[Verse 2]
I heard he was light skinned, stocky with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashing
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the Feds
Same crime, different trials nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention? Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchman
In due time I know you bitch niggas is listening
The world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, "Why you lie?"
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga this M.O.B
So believe me we enemies, I go against all odds
[Hook 2]
I'm hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, getting blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hoping my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds
[Verse 3]
Puffy getting bribed like a bitch
To hide that fact he did some shit he shouldn't have did
So we riding for that
And that nigga that was down for me, resting dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathing or dead
Lord listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a hasa, Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die, goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga
[Hook 1]
[Outro]
Against all odds
Twenty-one gun salute
One love to my true thug niggas (Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
Twenty-one gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representing to the fullest being soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, twenty-one gun salute
I salute you my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch made niggas, I'm coming for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is, nigga
You touch me I'm at you

Aight, I got my money right here, now I want war
